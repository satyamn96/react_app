            <p><span><strong>OUR PURPOSE</strong></span></p>
            <p>We don’t just like feeling good.<br />We like doing good too, with stuff like this:</p>
            <p><strong>EMPOWERING PEOPLE</strong><br />Life’s no party without people. They’re the true spirit of our brand, so we listen to them. From customers and employees to the wider community, we’re constantly learning from those around us – and work to build relationships that last.<br /><br /><br /><strong>GOOD CLEAN FUN</strong><br />Our products are low cal, all natural, gluten free and vegan… because at Gerry’s we’re committed to championing both physical and mental health. Who said you can’t be in it for a good time AND a long time?<br /><br /><br /><strong>FUTURE FOCUSED</strong><br />We’re doing our part to protect the world we live in. We’re environmentally focused, using recyclable packaging and sustainable supply chains. And we’re always searching for ways to do better.</p>
