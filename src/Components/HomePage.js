                <p><strong>Our collection of products are handmade in Britain &amp; beyond in small batches in collaboration with artists and makers – bringing our ideas and sketch book scribbles to life.</strong></p>
                <p><span>Each product is made in a way that is respectful and fair to the skilled person who made it. We partner with collaborators, not suppliers.</span><br /><br /><span>Our products are made from natural, organic and recycled ingredients as we strive to minimise our impact to our planet.</span><br /><br /><span>Durability is an important part of sustainability. So we create beautiful, useful products that are designed to be enjoyed for many years – products which gain character and beauty with age – wear-in, not out.</span><br /><br /><span>We believe that as humans; the clothing we wear, how they are made, and the brands we choose to support; are all an expression of our values and identity. Our money is our voting tokens.</span><br /><br /><span>We aim to inspire people to support ethical, sustainable and independent brands – buy less, buy well.</span></p>
                
                <p><span><strong>OUR PURPOSE</strong></span></p>
                <p>We don’t just like feeling good.<br />We like doing good too, with stuff like this:</p>
                <p><strong>EMPOWERING PEOPLE</strong><br />Life’s no party without people. They’re the true spirit of our brand, so we listen to them. From customers and employees to the wider community, we’re constantly learning from those around us – and work to build relationships that last.<br /><br /><br /><strong>GOOD CLEAN FUN</strong><br />Our products are low cal, all natural, gluten free and vegan… because at Gerry’s we’re committed to championing both physical and mental health. Who said you can’t be in it for a good time AND a long time?<br /><br /><br /><strong>FUTURE FOCUSED</strong><br />We’re doing our part to protect the world we live in. We’re environmentally focused, using recyclable packaging and sustainable supply chains. And we’re always searching for ways to do better.</p>
